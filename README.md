# MobWeb_BrandTurnover extension for Magento

This extension allows you to track each customer's turnover for a specific product brand. You can also set a limit for each brand. After every completed order, the extension checks if the customer has reached a limit turnover for a brand. Note: This extension does not add any value to your store by itself. You have to define your custom code once a customer reaches a turnover limit for a specific brand.

Example: I use this in one of my stores to automatically send the customer a "Thank You" coupon if he reaches a certain brand turnover amount. So for example we could announce to the customers: "Spend $1'000 on Sony products and get a 10% coupon for your next order". Another possible applications: Notify the sales department once a customer has spent over $10'000 on a specific brand, to schedule a call and thank the customer for their loyalty.

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible.
